It seems like child support payments should be a massive headache for him, but the extremely fertile 43-year-old isn’t struggling for cash. Between his frequent hosting appearances and the residuals from his high period, Cannon’s bank account is plenty flush — even with those child support payments.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Cannon’s discography isn’t overly impressive, but he’s been attached to The Masked Singer since the very start. He’s synonymous with the show, as its host, and his continued connection with it allows him to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain a steady cash flow</a>. That’s on top of Beat Shazam, which debuted in 2023, and likewise features Cannon — this time as a guest host.</p><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=937 data-injectable=false>Hosting duties seem to be the name of the game for Cannon, these days, and they must pay well. The star is worth an impressive $50 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, even after all his expenses. That number should stay pretty steady in the coming years — assuming Cannon maintains his hosting gigs — but could see a decline if the Cannon brood continues to grow at its current exponential rate. Even if he doesn’t retire with tens of millions in the bank, however, we certainly know Cannon has plenty of kids to care for him in his old age.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZ6esKx5wpqlp6eeqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
