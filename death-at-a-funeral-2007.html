Not that all of his characters are very amused. His story begins with the delivery of a casket to the British home of the mourning widow (<a href=#>Jane Asher</a>), who lives with her son Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) and his wife Jane (<a href=#>Keeley Hawes</a>), who hates living there so much she can hardly bear to remain even under the mournful circumstances. Not long after, a second casket is delivered, and we're off, and luckily we're all that's off.</p><p>Oz, working from a screenplay by <a href=#>Dean Craig</a>, populates the funeral party with disasters waiting to happen. One of them involves Daniel's eulogy, which we see him rehearsing from 3-by-5 cards, which are a useful precaution if you forget your dad's name (priests always have a helpful memo tucked away in their breviary). Daniel is a pre-failed novelist, which means he has not yet finished a novel in order to have it rejected. His despised brother Robert (<a href=#>Rupert Graves</a>) is a famed novelist living in Manhattan and is flying in just to make Daniel feel doubly miserable.</p><p>"Why do we only meet at funerals?" ask people who meet only at funerals. Simon (<a href=#>Alan Tudyk</a>), engaged to a family cousin named Martha (<a href=#>Daisy Donovan</a>), has been dragged along specifically to meet Martha's father (<a href=#>Peter Egan</a>), who is sure to hate him. Simon doesn't improve his chances when, for reasons I will not reveal, he finds himself naked and doing unidentifiable animal impressions. Simon makes a perfect bookend for old Uncle Alfie (<a href=#>Peter Vaughan</a>), who seems astonished to find himself clothed, not to mention invited anywhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dnJqsmGKutXnAZp2uppWnrq15kWlncA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
