She opened up about that experience when she began co-hosting&nbsp;The Night of Hate Comments&nbsp;in 2019, just months before her untimely death.

"They said they were sorry and they hadn't known it would become such a large issue. They said they'd taken their stress out on me."</p><p>Since Sulli's passing, idols and academics alike have been urging the Korean government to implement changes and put an end to the endemic of cyberbullying. "Freedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else's dignity is beyond that limit," Lee Dong-gwi, who is a a psychology professor at Seoul's Yonsei University, said (via&nbsp;Channel News Asia).&nbsp;"There need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9haX15e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5ymanqKhdqMGivoysrKWkmWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
