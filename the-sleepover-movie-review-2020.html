An automatic-driving car is then used for a scene where the kids are&nbsp;screaming for the lives; the same with a laser that later blows up a couple cars in a different car-oriented, screaming scene.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;It's an easy family comedy&nbsp;trick:&nbsp;if a sequence is only kind of funny, just make everybody scream throughout.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>You root for these kids, not just in their goals, but for them to have an adventure. The lazy plotting of "The Sleepover" gives them a mild one that consists of a lot of traveling and weak mysteries, like watching characters following a straight line that only sometimes zigs or zags. The action for the kids makes for underwhelming sequences of getting from Boston from Cape Cod, and obtaining colonial disguises along the way. The things that they learn about their mother in the process become more innocuous than they are surprising—she really&nbsp;loved <a href=#>William Butler</a> Yeats, and she had friends and a flame before having kids. If these kids somehow had access to a helicopter, or a portal,&nbsp;they’d be able to shave off the time “The Sleepover” wastes in simply getting them to the big event, contrivances that would also fit in with everything else here.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lo6GyprzOr5yrZZ2kw6qxjKucr6GVrHpzfJFp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
