Meanwhile, they seem to remain away from the media attention for now.</p><p>After he was drafted in 2022, they were proud of his achievement and were cheering for his dream.</p><p>An article by&nbsp;The Press Of Atlantic City&nbsp;was out, which included his parents’ statements.&nbsp;As stated in the post, he seems much closer to his mother and keeps checking on her via text messages after a family tragedy. Returning to his childhood, he grew up in Bridgeton since he was a toddler.</p><figure></figure><p>He also used to get excited when he heard motorcycles and used to mimic riding one by jumping on the couch, his mom stated. Also, he was close with his elder sister Celeste.</p><p>The young athlete has a social media presence and is an active user of Instagram with a verified account. He has accumulated 61.6k followers and is gaining more after the Chiefs picked him. However, he has only 30 posts and has barely shared images of his parents on the web.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=running-back-isiah-is-overcoming-family-tragedy></span>Running Back Isiah Is Overcoming Family Tragedy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Isiah has gone through a family tragedy recently, as stated by him in an interview with the media.</p><p>Unfortunately, he lost one of his loved ones from the family, whom he considered his best friend. His older sister, Celeste Cannon perished after becoming the victim of domestic violence when she was just 24.</p><p>He had helped his sister shift to a new place on West Main Street of Millville recently before the loss. He rushed towards her and helped her by carrying beds, television, couches, and other home appliances up the four steps, which was the entrance to the house.</p><p>However, three months later after she had moved there, on 20 September, his cousin appeared on the doorstep of his residence in Vineland with the nervewracking news and told him Celeste was no more.</p><figure></figure><p>But it was not the first time the family had confronted the tragedy. Isiah’s elder brother was also stabbed in January 2016 at 29 in Bridgeton.</p><p>Nevertheless, in memory of his fallen siblings, he has tattooed their names on his arms. Also, he plays in their memories which keeps him motivated as Isiah cannot go to them anymore for advice.</p><p>Additionally, Isiah has two more siblings in the family, while he is the youngest one. His mom has two additional older children other than him, namely Ricky Fowler and Felicia, who are both in their twenties.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=isiah-pacheo-has-dominican-origin-while-he-is-purely-american></span>Isiah Pacheo Has Dominican Origin While He Is Purely American<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pacheco is originally from Vineland in New Jersey and is an American by nationality.</p><p>While both his parents are born and bred in the USA, their families have hints of Dominican origin. Nevertheless, he started his athletic career at a young age and used to play for the Vineland Blitz.</p><p>He later joined Vineland High School and helped the team bag the Thanksgiving Day Classic against another school’s senior team, Thunderbolts. Back then, he used to play both as a quarterback and runningback.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmoa6kmaR6sa3CoZycp12Wu6V5xZ6jopuZlnqkrc2npqdlmai2orSMqZicoJWYvG68wKucp6yjYq6vsIyfmKahnK56c3uemK%2BYrKKUwK2JxKddmLCPqb%2BgwMt2nKxej62stb6%2BoaN2naNbrLmr06uWqayfcr%2By</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
