They reportedly met at Sports Illustrated Las Vegas party, developed an interest in each other, and started a romantic affair. For reasons best known to Adam and Anne, they decided they’ve had enough of the relationship in 2012.</p><p>Following the separation, the singer found solace in the arms of the South African-born Namibian model, Behati Prinsloo, the same year he parted with Anne. The only child of her parents, Behati studied at Grootfontein Secondary School but later dropped out after 9th Grade to pursue modeling. Over the years, she has become one of the most successful models in America and walked has walked in fashion shows for many big brands. Behati became a Pink contract model in 2008 and the following year, she also became a Victoria’s Secret Angel.</p><p>In 2019, Behati had an interview with Porter during which she opened up about a number of things, including how she met her now-husband. According to the model, she met Adam Levine through a mutual friend. The Maroon 5 frontman was looking for a girl who could do some action stuff for a music video and their mutual friend recommended Behati. Consequently, he sent her an email asking if she was down for the job. Although Behati ended up not doing the job, they continued communicating via email. “It was such a natural correspondence that we kind of fell in love over email”, the model said.</p><p>One month later, she travelled to Los Angeles for a job and she went to see him at the studio. This would be their first time of meeting face to face. Later on, Adam took her out for dinner and their connection was immediate as the model said “we talked for hours and had the best time. It was love at first sight, it was crazy”.</p><p>In the same&nbsp;Porter publication, Behati Prinsloo revealed that along the line, they broke up for two months but it was not long before it dawned on them that it was the worst decision. They then reconciled, got engaged in July 2013, and tied the knot on 19 July 2014.&nbsp;Their wedding, which took place at Flora Farms in Los Cabos, Mexico, was witnessed by the couple’s friends and family numbering approximately 275.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-singer-is-a-proud-father-of-two%e2%80%a6and-counting></span><strong>The Singer Is A Proud Father Of Two…And Counting</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><strong>Names:</strong><strong>Dusty Rose Levine</strong> (Born 2017) and <strong>Gio Grace Levine</strong> (Born 2018)</span></p><p>Levine and his wife have two children together, both daughters named&nbsp;<span class="LrzXr kno-fv">Dusty Rose Levine and Gio Grace Levine. Dusty was born in 2017 and her mother Prinsloo got pregnant with their second daughter just seven months after her birth and had Gio in 2018.</span></p><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv">Unlike some other celebrities, the famous couple is very private when it comes to their kids and as a result, they only share photos of them occasionally on social media with their faces rarely showing. </span>In their most recent family picture posted on Prinsloo’s Instagram account during 2018 Thanksgiving, the singer and model are seen standing next to their little girls as the kids play on a set of swing.</p><h4><strong>The Girls’ Personalities</strong></h4><p>Talking about her daughters’ personalities in the Porter interview, Behati said Dusty, who is a Virgo, is really bossy and has a greater sense of humor, which was very obvious even while she was as little as two years old. Gio, on the other hand, she said, is cuddly and sweet. I’m excited to see them a little older and really see their personalities [develop] because I think they’ll be very different”, she added.</p><p>Being the daughter of a fashion model, it is not surprising that Dusty, at her age, already has her own sense of style, as Behati said. As a result, she tends to say no when her mother wants to dress her in something different from what she wants to wear thus, forcing her (Behati) to go through the stress of ransacking the whole wardrobe until she (Dusty) finds what she wants to wear. “She definitely has her own thing going; she’ll wear a T-shirt with a tank top over it, leggings, a tutu and shoes that are too big. She’s pretty wild – a real rock’n’roll baby! She keeps me on my toes.”</p><h4><strong>Being Parents Is No Child’s Play</strong></h4><p>Speaking to People in March 2019, the Victoria’s Secret Angel described her husband as “an incredible dad” and “very hands-on”. She said she had thought she would be the stricter parent between them but Levine took it “and I’m okay with it”. Speaking further, the model revealed that her husband was very excited to be a father to their daughters and he plays his role with dedicated.</p><p>Behati, however, admitted that being a mother was a very challenging responsibility which is made even more difficult when trying to balance it with work. Nevertheless, she joined in on model Kate Upton’s #sharestrong social media campaign in August 2019, encouraging empowerment and positivity, and seized the opportunity to say that even though being a mother had its highs and lows, she wouldn’t change a single thing because “being mom to Dusty and Gio keeps me strong, motivated and empowered”.</p><h4><strong>Expanding Their Family</strong></h4><p>Although the super couple already has two children to cater for, they still have plans of having more. Back in May 2019, Behati stopped by The Ellen DeGeneres Show and opened up about her and her husband’s plans to have more babies. Before then, she also told People in May that she wanted a big family, being an only child herself.</p><p>Speaking with Ellen, the supermodel revealed that her husband wants five children. However, she added, “I thought I wanted five, but now I think maybe like, three or four will be good.”</p><p>In March 2020, There were speculations that Prinsloo was expecting another child. This came up after a very blurry photo, which some fans erroneously thought was a sonogram, was posted to her account on Instagram. But the mother of two quickly shot down the rumors with the message below:</p><p>The following month, Adam Levine confirmed that his wife was neither pregnant nor ready to have more kids yet. “I think if I asked her to have another baby right now she’d punch me in the f—ing face because she’s not ready,” he told Howard Stern on his&nbsp;Sirius XM Show. So while it is certain the couple is yet to hang their boot with regards to childbearing, it is not known when they would be ready to have another child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-the-singers-brother-michael-levine></span><strong>Meet The Singer’s Brother, Michael Levine</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Full Name:</strong> Michael Noah Levine</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> Unknown</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Singer/Actor</p><p>If you come across anyone wondering if Adam Levin is sexually attracted to his gender, it’s probably because of his brother, Michael Levine.

He lived with his father on weekdays and with his mother on weekends. The divorce affected Adam so much that he had to check into therapy to handle the situation. Adam has revealed in interviews that he got his love for music from his mother and has named his early influences to include Fleetwood Mac and&nbsp;The Beatles. Levine attended Brentwood High School in Los Angeles where his passion for music grew.</p><p>In high school, Adam&nbsp;met&nbsp;Mickey Madden, Jesse Carmichael, and Ryan Dusick and together they formed a garage band named&nbsp;Kara’s Flowers in 1994. With Adam on the vocals and strings, Kara’s Flowers began performing in nightclubs. Fast forward three years later in 1997, they were spotted by&nbsp;independent producer Tommy Allen while they were playing in a Malibu beach party. Allen had the band record an 11 track album titled “The Fourth World”. The album was released via&nbsp;Reprise Records but failed to attain success selling a mere 5,000 copies in the US. As a result of the commercial failure, Reprise Records dropped the band&nbsp;which later disbanded.</p><p>Four years later the band members reunited and recorded a demo tape. After several failed attempts to distribute the demo, it finally caught the attention of Octone Records executives who added guitarist&nbsp;James Valentine to the group to form Maroon 5. In June 2002 Maroon 5 released their debut album “Songs About Jane” which comprised of lyrics Adam wrote about his ex-girlfriend, Jane. “Songs About Jane” slowly gained popularity and became a hit selling over 10 million copies with the hit single&nbsp;“This Love” which was a commercial success.</p><p>The album brought the band their first two Grammy Awards in quick succession. One was in 2005 for Best New Artist and the other in 2006 for&nbsp;Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The album as of August 2015 has <strong>made over $15 million</strong> worldwide from sales.</p><p>Maroon 5 released their follow up album “It Won’t Be Soon Before Long” in 2007. The album produced 3 singles which all received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Performance by Duo with the lead&nbsp;“Makes Me Wonder” winning them the award. The album sales grossed <strong>over $2.3 million</strong> in the US alone.</p><p>Their third studio album “Hands All Over” released in 2010 saw a sluggish growth until the release of the fourth single “Moves Like Jagger” which became an instant hit worldwide. “Moves like Jagger” sold 8.5 million copies and according to Adam, the song totally revived the band. “Payphone” was another hit single which helped its succeeding&nbsp;2012 album “Overexposed” win a Grammy Award. The album sales worldwide grossed about $5 million.&nbsp;The 2015 Maroon 5 World Tour Album to promote their 2014 album <strong>“V” grossed over $15 million</strong> in ticket sales as of August 2015.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-net-worth-and-career-earnings></span><strong>His Net Worth and Career Earnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Disregarding the earnings he bagged from activities with Maroon 5 as highlighted above, Adam has been individually pocketing enviable amounts here and there. For instance, he landed a berth as one of the judges and coaches on the musical reality TV show “The Voice” since its debut in 2011. Adam reportedly earns $6 million every season for his role.</p><p>More to that, the musician&nbsp;has various ventures in his business portfolio.

In 2012, Adam bought a ranch-style mansion in the gated Beverly Hills&nbsp;enclave known as Wallingford Estates for roughly $5 million. In 2014 just prior&nbsp;his marriage to Victoria Secret beauty, Behati Prinsloo, Adam completely refurbished the entire house employing the services of&nbsp;L.A-based designer Mark Haddawy.</p><p>The&nbsp;7,100-square-feet house which sits on over a 3-acre piece includes 5 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, a media and screening room, spa facility and more.
