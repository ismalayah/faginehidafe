It’s about the death of naivete and the birth of something just as pure but far more potent. In its ten-episode first season, “The Great” charts the transformation of Catherine, Empress of Russia (<a href=#>Elle Fanning</a>) from guileless romantic to political animal; it is not an easy path, which was true for the real Catherine as well. (The series kindly reminds viewers near the top of each episode that this is, at most, an “occasionally true story.”) That idealistic streak does not make “The Great” any less funny or chaotic, but it does serve to anchor it in something appealingly innocent and well-intentioned. Catherine dreams of a better world, and “The Great” seems to believe that even now, such a world is possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5ebb7e4e306fcc091d9497dd/content_the-great-image.jpg><p>Of course, some of that heady romantic streak can be credited to Fanning (also a producer), who&nbsp;finds many shades between the naive Catherine who begins the series and the disillusioned one who ends the first season. When Catherine, an Austrian teenager dreaming of a great love, first arrives in Russia, it’s with the hope that her destined husband, Peter III (<a href=#>Nicholas Hoult</a>) will follow through on the grand declarations of love in his letters. He didn’t write them, and that’s the first and least brutal of the many rude awakenings in store for the young Empress. Her intelligence and determination slowly earn her allies in Peter’s cruel court, namely his eccentric and salacious aunt (Belinda Bromilow), his literate and awkward political advisor (<a href=#>Sacha Dhawan</a>), and her maid Marial (<a href=#>Phoebe Fox</a>), a sharp-tongued former member of the court forced into the laboring class by the mercurial, vindictive Peter. It soon becomes clear that she can’t look forward to a love affair with her husband, so with the help of her these few friends and others, she embarks on a romance with her adoptive country.&nbsp;</p><p>The courtship isn’t always sweet. The series wastes no time in addressing <a href=#>the horse thing</a>; she often endures condescension, if not cruelty, from those around her, including her husband. (At one point Peter senses she may be upset with him, and casually asks if it’s because he recently killed her pet bear and punched her in the stomach.) But because Catherine fixes her sights on a specific goal so quickly, and because her views on how best to reach that goal often differ from those of the people advising her, the story never feels like it revels in suffering. It’s always about progress, the obstacles that impede it, and the conflicts that emerge as a result. Even when making pit stops for absurdity (the odd dance number, say) it feels purposeful and lively, and even when the violence spikes, the writing and Fanning’s performance ensure that “The Great” never fixates on the darkness. There’s simply too much to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqGtnKrAbsDHnmSgqpWWwW610magpqWVo8CmuNhmnKefkZy2r7M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
