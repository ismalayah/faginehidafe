Susannah was magic in human form, a piece of something otherworldly packaged together within a woman who could weave sunlight of raindrops, and she was the glue that held everyone together.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=893 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Her death</a> wasn‚Äôt a surprise to those who read Jenny Han‚Äôs books, nor was it a shock to anyone who had been paying attention to teasers and trailers, but we have been lucky enough to get moments with Susannah in flashbacks, and we have a feeling we‚Äôve not seen the last of her yet. The truth is, there are many things season two will bring us that we‚Äôve only seen in glimpses so far, and from a soundtrack that‚Äôs bringing us to tears to moments that are shattering our hearts and putting them back together.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>One way in which our hearts have been tied back together is by the trip Belly and Conrad took to the beach house for the chance to experience snow on the beach. The scene in the books was so important to fans that Jenny Han knew it had to make the series, and it did so in ways I wasn‚Äôt prepared for ‚Äî in fact, I don‚Äôt think any of us were.</p><h2 id=h-that-belly-conrad-moment-is-serving-serious-romeo-juliet-vibes data-injectable=false>That Belly/Conrad moment is serving serious Romeo & Juliet vibes</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a title=@ruespeaks href=#>@ruespeaks</a><p>The Summer I Turned Pretty S2 üé∂ @Jenny Han <a title=thesummeriturnedpretty href=#>#thesummeriturnedpretty</a> <a title=kissingyou href=#>#kissingyou</a> <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Jakarra Taylor" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Jakarra Taylor</a></figure><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Belly and Conrad going to the beach was the perfect scene for many reasons; one is that it was taken directly from the books, even more brilliantly than any of us could have imagined. There was magic in Conrad drinking out of his The Simpsons mug, a warm sense of comedy in him saying Belly‚Äôs specialty hot cocoa was ‚Äúdusty,‚Äù and an authentic sense of urgency in that this was the first time they were truly alone in the home that allowed them to fall in love with one another.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Conrad reached out and touched Belly‚Äôs cheek but pulled back, almost scared that he might ruin the moment somehow. Belly was happy to be in his presence, to be near him, and then the most beautiful thing happened: snow on the beach. When they got back inside, a warm fire was there to warm them up, and they found solace in one another ‚Äî and something else too.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>Belly wanted everything with Conrad, and while the scene in the book stopped at kissing, the series took things a step further; the song as Belly and Conrad shared their most magnificent moment is giving us Romeo and Juliet vibes. Just as Belly and Conrad realize the importance of what lies before them, Romeo and Juliet lock eyes, and we couldn‚Äôt watch The Summer I Turned Pretty without thinking of that scene.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>RueSpeaks describes it perfectly; it was a big moment for us and lovers of romance and larger-than-life belonging to one another everywhere. It was something Shakespearean in magnitude; almost otherworldly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>If you‚Äôve never seen that version of Romeo and Juliet, we recommend canceling your plans and watching it this evening (or you could watch it for the umpteenth time if you already have), but no matter what, we love the way Jenny Han takes characters who could be written off as silly young adults and gives them a connection to a love that is transformative in nature, all-encompassing as it ebbs and flows.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Conrad gave us Mr. Darcy vibes</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@dvnnisimone href=#>@dvnnisimone</a><p>this is how i know i picked the right team <a title=teamconrad href=#>#teamconrad</a> <a title=thesummeriturnedpretty href=#>#thesummeriturnedpretty</a> <a title=tsitpseason2 href=#>#tsitpseason2</a> <a title=conradfisher href=#>#conradfisher</a> <a title=bellyconklin href=#>#bellyconklin</a> <a title=jennyhan href=#>#jennyhan</a> <a title=tsitp href=#>#tsitp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ som original - ‚òÜ" href=#>‚ô¨ som original ‚Äì ‚òÜ</a></figure><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>Speaking of larger-than-life love, we had to go back and watch this scene (not that it was a chore or anything) after we saw this TikTok video. Conrad giving us Darcy vibes is just everything a bibliophile could want, and I, for one, had to catch my breath once I saw this. I am very much Team Conrad, so much so that I ranted about it at a Fourth of July get-together, and in all of these little moments, I‚Äôm reminded that Team Conrad stays winning.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He‚Äôs also serving Joe Burrow</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@devinjacobengle href=#>@devinjacobengle</a><p>Did anyone else notice this? <a title=thesummeriturnedpretty href=#>#thesummeriturnedpretty</a> <a title=joeburrow href=#>#joeburrow</a> <a title=bengals href=#>#bengals</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - devinjacobengle" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì devinjacobengle</a></figure><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>As a major Cincinnati Bengals fan, I saw this TikTok, and it stopped me in my tracks; I, too, saw Conrad‚Äôs ‚Äúromantic and wet‚Äù hair and thought of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Headband Joe,</a> but I chalked it up to being a little bit like Belly after a few pomegranate margaritas.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Seeing this TikTok solidified a few things for me: first things first ‚Äî Team Conrad stays winning. Second, Joe Burrow is coming up in casual conversation more often (as he deserves), and third ‚Äî boys with wet hair really are romantic. Thanks, Jenny Han!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>This scene, in all of its special glory</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true><a title=@marscinema href=#>@marscinema</a><p>its been 4 days and i still cant comprehend how beautiful this scene was <a title=thesummeriturnedpretty href=#>#thesummeriturnedpretty</a> <a title=tsitp href=#>#tsitp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - maria 3" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì maria &lt;3</a></figure><p data-characters=632 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>As we said above, this memorable scene meant a lot to those of us who have been fans of the story since we read them so many years ago. In rereading them, we recognized it immediately, and as we eagerly anticipated season two, this was the moment we most hoped for. Belly and Conrad sitting together in the beach house, waiting for snow on the beach, falling more in love than even they could have imagined ‚Äî&nbsp;and the way he grazes her cheek with his hand, be still our beating hearts. It‚Äôs the delicate way that he looks at Belly, seeing her as a treasure, and the world would be a better place with more Conrads in it!</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>Of course, it wasn‚Äôt all butterflies and laughter; many tears were shed in the first few episodes, many‚Ä¶many tears.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>We‚Äôve got big emotions, okay?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true><a title=@k4zes href=#>@k4zes</a><p>this scene broke my heart- <a title=thesummeriturnedpretty href=#>#thesummeriturnedpretty</a> <a title=bonrad href=#>#bonrad</a> <a title=bellyconklin href=#>#bellyconklin</a> <a title=conradfisher href=#>#conradfisher</a> <a title=bellyconrad href=#>#bellyconrad</a> <a title=tsitp href=#>#tsitp</a> <a title=thesummeriturnedprettyedit href=#>#thesummeriturnedprettyedit</a> <a title=tsitpedit href=#>#tsitpedit</a> <a title=teamconrad href=#>#teamconrad</a> <a title=bellyandconrad href=#>#bellyandconrad</a> <a title=conradfisheredit href=#>#conradfisheredit</a> <a title=bellyconklinedit href=#>#bellyconklinedit</a> <a title=conradandbelly href=#>#conradandbelly</a> <a title=lolatung href=#>#lolatung</a> <a title=chrisbriney href=#>#chrisbriney</a> <a title=bellyconradedit href=#>#bellyconradedit</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - t ÷¥ ‡£™ñ§ê" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì t ÷¥ ‡£™ñ§ê</a></figure><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>We knew it was coming, but nothing could have prepared us for how this scene played out. Belly was begging Conrad to say something; all the while, he was praying she‚Äôd stop talking altogether. She was breaking things off, calling it quits, and while there‚Äôs a piece of his story that has yet to unfold on television that we won‚Äôt spoil for you here, the other part of what was happening was that Conrad was afraid again, scared that his mom‚Äôs cancer was soon to take her life.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>He didn‚Äôt know what capacity for love he could give Belly, but he didn‚Äôt want it to end. In the same breath, however, he didn‚Äôt want her to keep holding on if he kept hurting her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true><a title=@meolah href=#>@meolah</a><p>im only on the first episode of The Summer I Turned Pretty and i already cried twice</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - meolah" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì meolah</a></figure><p data-characters=59 data-current-count=59 data-injectable=false>See what we mean?
