The player then has the opportunity to capture the <a href=# title="Psychic (type)">Psychic</a>/<a href=# title="Grass (type)">Grass</a> Pokémon.</p><p>In the original Western releases of Pokémon Crystal, there is no way of obtaining the GS Ball, as no event equivalent to the one present in the Japanese version was ever offered to players of the Western versions of the game. Without the GS Ball, the Celebi event cannot be triggered. However, it is possible to obtain the item by hacking or exploiting <a href=# title=Glitch>glitches</a> within the game. Some game-enhancing devices, however, such as the <a href=# title=GameShark>GameShark</a>, can be used to generate the GS Ball right in the player's <a href=# title=Bag>Bag</a> in all versions of the game.</p><p>In the <a href=# title="Virtual Console">Virtual Console</a> release of Pokémon Crystal, the GS Ball can be obtained without an event, allowing players to trigger the Celebi event at the shrine regardless of language.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Generation_IV>Generation IV</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/8a/Pichupichushrine.png/345px-Pichupichushrine.png decoding=async width=230 height=325 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>The shrine appears in <a href=# title="Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions">Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver</a>, in the same location as in <a href=# title="Generation II">Generation II</a>, in the <a href=# title="Ilex Forest">Ilex Forest</a>. <a href=# title="Spiky-eared Pichu">Spiky-eared Pichu</a> will appear at the Ilex Forest shrine and will join the player's party if the player interacts with it while a <a href=# title="List of event Pokémon with in-game effects">Pikachu-colored Pichu</a> is their walking Pokémon.

In <i><a href=# title=HS13>Celebi and Joy!</a></i>, <a href=# title="Marion Town">Marion Town</a> was shown to have a forest shrine dedicated to <a href=# title="Celebi (Pokémon)">Celebi</a>, which also bore a strong resemblance to the one shown in Ilex Forest.</p><p>In <i>A Farfetch'd Tale</i>, <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> got lost and hungry in the <a href=# title="Ilex Forest">Ilex Forest</a>. <a href=# title="Meowth (Team Rocket)">Meowth</a> smelled food nearby and they found the small Ilex Forest shrine where two dumplings were left there as offerings. <a href=# title=Jessie>Jessie</a> snatched one, Meowth the other, leaving <a href=# title=James>James</a> empty-handed. They then spotted a rare <a href=# title="Farfetch'd (Pokémon)">Farfetch'd</a> and quickly left to pursue it. <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a> arrived at the shrine with <a href=# title="Sylvester (EP145)">Sylvester</a>, who said it was a shrine to the spirit that watches over the forest. In order to find the lost Farfetch'd, they all ran in different directions, and agreed to meet back at the shrine in an hour.</p><p>Although the shrine seen in <i>Celebi: The Voice of the Forest</i> wasn't the same Ilex Forest shrine, it does contain the same qualities. It is found in the deepest part of the forest, and many people say that the shrine is linked to the Mythical Pokémon, Celebi, who supposedly lives inside the forest shrine, as the forest guardian. The shrine was first seen when <a href=# title=Sam>Sam</a> ran into it before <a href=# title="Celebi (M04)">Celebi</a> <a href=# title="Time travel">transported him into the future</a>, and it reappeared as Sam arrived into the future.</p><p>In <i>Celebi and Joy!</i>, <a href=# title=Ritchie>Ritchie</a> and <a href=# title=Sparky>Sparky</a> saved a young <a href=# title="Nurse Joy">Nurse Joy</a> hanging from a cliff with some help from her <a href=# title="Ponyta (Pokémon)">Ponyta</a>. Joy explained that she saw some flowers that she wanted to pick for Celebi when she fell. She then explained the legends that say that a Celebi lives in this forest, and she believed it was true. To prove it, she showed them a shrine that was put up in the forest a long time ago. Later that night, during a thunderstorm, <a href=# title="Nick's father">Nick's father</a> was informed that Joy ran into the forest. As Ritchie and <a href=# title="Nick (HS13)">Nick</a> headed out to look for Joy, they found her unconscious near the shrine. As a fire raged near them, a Celebi appeared and protected them from the danger.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN032>Time After Time!</a></i>, <a href=# title=Goh>Goh</a> discovered the shrine while searching around Ilex Forest for Pokémon to catch. In-between the shrine's doors, he discovered a letter left for him by his childhood friend <a href=# title=Horace>Horace</a>, explaining why he hadn't been able to meet him years earlier on the day they had promised to meet each other in order to look for the shrine. Horace then appeared, and as the childhood friends reunited, two Celebi, including a <a href=# title="Shiny Pokémon">Shiny</a> one, were briefly seen observing them before flying away.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_manga>In the manga</span></h2><a href=# class=image title=201><img alt=201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c4/Ani201ODEX.png decoding=async width=32 height=32 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# class=image title=201><img alt=201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c4/Ani201ODEX.png decoding=async width=32 height=32 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Adventures></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Adventures>Pokémon Adventures</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/c/c1/Ilex_Forest_shrine_Adventures.png/375px-Ilex_Forest_shrine_Adventures.png decoding=async width=250 height=198 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h4><span id=Gold.2C_Silver_.26_Crystal_arc></span><span class=mw-headline id=Gold,_Silver_&_Crystal_arc><a href=# title="Gold, Silver & Crystal arc (Adventures)"><i>Gold, Silver & Crystal</i> arc</a></span></h4><p>The shrine first appeared in <i><a href=# title=PS103>You Ain't Nothin' but a Houndour</a></i>, where <a href=# title="Gold (Adventures)">Gold</a> hid behind it to take cover from a <a href=# title="Farfetch'd (Pokémon)">Farfetch'd</a> that was attacking him.
