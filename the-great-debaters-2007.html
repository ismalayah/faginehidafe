The school's English professor, Melvin Tolson (<a href=#>Denzel Washington</a>), is a taskmaster who demands the highest standards from his debate team, and they're rewarded with a national championship. That's what the "sports movie" is about, but the movie is about so much more, and in ways that do not follow formulas.</p><p>There are, for example, Tolson's secret lives. Wearing overalls and work boots, he ventures out incognito as an organizer for a national sharecropper's union. He's a dangerous radical, local whites believe: probably a communist. But he's organizing both poor whites and blacks, whose servitude is equal.</p><p>He keeps his politics out of the classroom, however, where he conceals a different kind of secret: He is one of America's leading poets. Although the movie barely touches on it, Tolson published long poems in such magazines as the Atlantic Monthly and in 1947 was actually named poet laureate of Liberia. Ironic, that his role as a debate coach would win him greater fame today.</p><p>He holds grueling auditions and selects four team members: Henry Lowe (<a href=#>Nate Parker</a>), who drinks and fools around but is formidably intelligent; Hamilton Burgess (<a href=#>Jermaine Williams</a>), a superb debater; James Farmer Jr. (<a href=#>Forest Whitaker</a>), a precocious 14-year-old who is their researcher, and Samantha Booke (<a href=#>Jurnee Smollett</a>), the substitute, and the only female debater they've heard of. Tolson drills them, disciplines them, counsels them and leads them to a string of victories that culminates a victory over Harvard, the national champion.</p><p>We get a good sense of the nurturing black community that has produced these students, in particular James Farmer Sr. (Forest Whitaker), a preacher. (Young <a href=#>Denzel Whitaker</a>, as his son, is no relation, and not named after Washington). James Jr. would go on to found the Congress of Racial Equality.</p><p>Tolson drives his team on long road trips to out-of-town debates, and one night traveling late, they have the defining emotional experience of the film: They happen upon a scene where a white mob has just lynched a black man and set his body afire. They barely escape with their own lives. And daily life for them is fraught with racist peril; especially for Tolson, who has been singled out by the local sheriff as a rabble-rouser. These experiences inform their debates as much as formal research.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55ll6eyosCMnZybmaSav7R5kWlncA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
