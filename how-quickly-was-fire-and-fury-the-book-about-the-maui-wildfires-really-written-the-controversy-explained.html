I’m sorry but that just sounds made up to me. <a title=lahaina href=#>#lahaina</a> <a title=maui href=#>#maui</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Myriah" href=#>♬ original sound – Myriah</a></figure><p data-characters=645 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>A further look at Stones’ author page on Amazon.com yields a number of suspicious, uncanny titles, most of them claiming to be life stories of such figures as Nicholas Sparks, Hunter Biden, Nora Roberts, and Shannen Doherty, just to name a few. Each of these books — like Fire and Fury — number in the ballpark of 30-40 pages, which anyone could tell you is not nearly enough pages for a legitimate book about a public figure’s life story, and certainly, not enough pages to hold together commentary on climate change, the ins and outs of the Hawaii wildfires’ origins, and the accounts of the victims who lived through it.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>In case it isn’t obvious by this point, there’s a good to fair chance that “Dr. Miles Stones” isn’t a real person; given an impossibly fast publishing timeline that somehow transcends the laws of physics and a suspicious and underwhelmingly crafted bibliography to boot, the most likely possibility is that Fire and Fury and the rest of these books published under this name were coughed up by artificial intelligence.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=false>But the biggest takeaway from this is how disgusting the entire development is; beyond the shady, heinous, and downright laughable practice that this mystery person is indulging in, the simple fact that they attempted to publish a cheap faux-account of a still-ongoing disaster that’s claimed an indefinite number of lives, all for the sake of a fast and probably insubstantial buck, is some bottom-of-the-barrel apathy that karma will hopefully act swiftly upon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeSpLysv46hprBloaq2pLfLsmSwmaNis6q%2BxGaYp5xdm8KzxYytn55lkqS8rHnAm6aurF2ptaZ5zJqsomWnnrmlssirnKxlopqurbjYZq6roaSpsq9506GcZpufo8Gzu9WeqayxXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
