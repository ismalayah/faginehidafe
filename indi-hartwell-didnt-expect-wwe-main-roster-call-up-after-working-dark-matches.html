Indi Hartwell and Dexter Lumis got married as part of the storyline back in September, as part of NXT 2.0’s new direction. Since then Hartwell has also been competing in tag team matches often."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It turned into two dark matches, where Hartwell revealed that she got a positive response. Due to this, she is hopeful about getting a main roster call-up in the future.</p><p>“I didn’t really think I was getting called up because the dark match kinda of came out of nowhere. I got told the night before I had to fly out. I think it was because someone got injured and I was basically filling in for them. One dark match turned into two dark matches, which I felt like was a good sign and I got really good feedback, had an amazing experience there, and I left both of those matches feeling really good. Hopefully, when the time comes for me to get called up, I’m well-prepared for it.”</p><p>Indi Hartwell&nbsp;partnered up with Persia Pirotta in a Triple Threat Ladder Match at Halloween Havoc for the NXT Women’s Tag Team Titles. They were unable to win the match, but certainly made a great impression on the crowd. We will have to wait and see if Hartwell will eventually be called up to the main roster or not.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
