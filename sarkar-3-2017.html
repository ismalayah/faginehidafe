For example: when we last saw Subhash, it was right&nbsp;after&nbsp;the death of loyal&nbsp;son&nbsp;Shankar (<a href=#>Abhishek Bachchan</a>, Amitabh's real-life son). This loss is represented in "Sarkar 3" with unmoving&nbsp;recurring&nbsp;shots of Amitabh watering a plant by a portrait of Abhishek. Subhash is&nbsp;still&nbsp;the head of his "shadow government"-style organization, a group of mafia-like leaders who claim they are the face of their community's dissatisfaction with a&nbsp;corrupt politicians, police men, and business tycoons. He&nbsp;takes on corrupt politician Govind Deshpande (<a href=#>Manoj Bajpayee</a>) and his shadowy&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;patron Michael Vallya (<a href=#>Jackie Shroff</a>) with the help of hot-head&nbsp;grand-son Shivaji (<a href=#>Amit Sadh</a>), the son of Subhash's prodigal (and&nbsp;also dead) son Vishnu (Kay Kay Menon).&nbsp;</p><p>This new&nbsp;story is disappointing on multiple levels. For starters: "Sarkar 3" begins as a story about two ideologically opposed characters, Govind and Subhash. Govind, during convincing political rally speeches, raises some valid points about Subhash's style of vigilante governance: why trust someone who&nbsp;rules through intimidation,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is not officially&nbsp;accountable to anyone? But Varma and Subhash wave away these concerns by making a puppet controlled by&nbsp;Vallya, a cartoonishly self-involved&nbsp;villain&nbsp;who wears sunglasses (at night, even) and&nbsp;is constantly futzing with his iPhone. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if many of the analogies and metaphors that Govind and Michael use when they're privately talking about crushing Subhash weren't so dumb. Govind makes a migraine-inducing analogy where he&nbsp;compares Subhash's adviser Gokul (<a href=#>Ronit Roy</a>) to a powerful wave whose influence must be controlled in order to take away a small, but&nbsp;worrisome amount&nbsp;of metaphorical sand&nbsp;from under Subhash's feet.&nbsp;</p><p>And then there's all the condescending, sexist lectures that Michael gives to his airhead girlfriend—he even praises her for being heartless—shortly before he kills her because "she's starting to ask too many questions." Which also wouldn't be so bad if Shroff didn't deliver an underwhelming performance.&nbsp;Bachchan, a natural charmer, doesn't fare much better. He's constantly&nbsp;filmed in suffocating&nbsp;extreme close-up.&nbsp;In fact, Bachchan&nbsp;spends much of the film&nbsp;glowering imperiously at antagonists in dimly lit rooms&nbsp;while an uninspired&nbsp;<a href=#>Ravi Shankar</a> (not that one, another composer&nbsp;with the same name) score forcefully&nbsp;underlines every tacit&nbsp;insult, and caustic&nbsp;declaration&nbsp;that Bachchan delivers. This man may be powerful, but you&nbsp;can't tell just by looking at "Sarkar 3."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46smKujkad6dHmRaWhw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
