Never one to let their fanbase down, popular digital artist Boss Logic has done it again. This time? Wolverine’s successor.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comic book writer Mark Millar</a> offered up his prediction that the next actor to portray the vicious hero will be none other than Egerton, Jackman’s Eddie and the Eagle co-star. And now, the artist has shared his quirky take on the latest rumors about who the next Logan will be.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>First, he posted an edit that’s originally a promotional pic from Eddie with the addition of a Wolverine mask, but it’s still adorable as hell. After that, Boss Logic then shared some proper fan art of how Egerton could look as the iconic mutant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hugh-Jackman-Taron-Egerton-Wolverine-Suit.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/66147615_2443940372494562_2381002560597820120_n.jpg><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>When asked about his possible future as the most famous X-Man, Egerton recently told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Spy</a> that as far as he knows, it’s just a rumor.</p><p>“That one I think is just a rumour. As far as I’m aware it’s unfounded. I don’t know if I’m quite grisly enough.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>He didn’t completely shut it all down, however, saying:</p><p>“I mean if the people at Marvel think I am then great, let’s go. But I think there are probably better candidates. But I would love to be involved with that world somewhere.”</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Take all this with a grain of salt, of course. Even Daniel Radcliffe once joked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being the next Wolverine</a>, and received the fan art treatment, too. It wasn’t bad, but seeing Harry Potter as Weapon X? No thanks. I’m still trying to digest Cedric Diggory being our next Batman, so I’m not sure my imagination can handle that.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>With all the MCU news coming from this year’s SDCC, it’s almost possible to get superhero overload right now, but tell us, who has your vote as the next <strong>Wolverine</strong>? Does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan favorite Tom Hardy</a> get your nomination, or is there a lesser known actor you’d like to see in the role? Spill it in the comments section down below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq5qqn6N6prPEq6uopl2XsqS7zJ6qZq%2BfocOmvsinnGaZoql8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
