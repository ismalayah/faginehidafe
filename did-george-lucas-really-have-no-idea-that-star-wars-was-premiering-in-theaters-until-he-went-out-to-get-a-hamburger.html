In fact, Lucas previously explained that he ultimately bolted to Hawaii to take a vacation with his friend and fellow director Steven Spielberg just to get away from what he thought was going to be negative feedback."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It must be a premiere or something.’”</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>Incredibly, it still hadn’t dawned on Lucas or anyone else that the movie people were waiting to see was indeed Star Wars.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>So, there’s Lucas, eating at a Hamburger Hamlet — all of which has since closed — and enjoying a meal while completely oblivious that the line at the movie theater across the street was for his film’s premiere.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>What happened next? They ate, of course. Then they later left and realized what was happening.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>As Lucas tells the story, “It wasn’t until we walked outside that we could see that it was Star Wars. It was like a mob. They closed the street off!”</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>At this point, the segment of Lucas’ story ends, but one can deduce from earlier interviews that he’s given that the long lines didn’t convince him the movie was going to be well-received. So, he still decided to take off to Hawaii and ignore the attention. It was a pretty worthwhile vacation considering it’s when Spielberg and Lucas first discussed creating a character together named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Alan Ladd, Jr., the executive at 20th Century Fox Studios who signed Lucas to a movie deal <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after watching American Graffiti</a> and was one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">few who believed in him</a>, kept calling Lucas to tell him how popular the movie was rapidly becoming. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2015 interview</a>, Lucas explains that he responded to Ladd by saying, “Laddie, calm down. It’s a science fiction film. Science fiction films get a good old group of sci-fi fans. They’ll go to anything the first week. Wait for a couple weeks, and you’ll see what it’s really gonna do.”</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>It wasn’t until Ladd called Lucas a few days later and told him about a CBS news segment on the movie with Walter Cronkite that he was convinced that Star Wars was going to be big. Ironically, Lucas’ special effects crew later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">played a prank on Cronkite</a> when the news anchor visited to do a segment about The Empire Strikes Back.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>What about the actors on the hit film? Did they take such convincing also?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Mark Hamill <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told CBS Sunday Morning earlier this year</a> that long lines at the premiere didn’t convince him either, and that it wasn’t until they were flying around the country on their publicity tour that he realized Star Wars was going to be a hit.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>He explained, “It was Carrie, Harrison, and me. When we landed in Chicago, I looked out and saw there were crowds outside. I say, ‘Hey, you guys, there must be somebody famous on this plane!’ We’re looking around for some superstar athlete or whatever.”</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Hamill said he realized the crowds were for them when he noticed that many people in the crowd were dressed like Star Wars characters.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>So, George Lucas wasn’t the only one who worked on the film who just couldn’t imagine it being such a major hit.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Lucas has also explained that he normally goes on vacation somewhere when his movies come out as a way to not worry about how they will do. He doesn’t explain, however, if he generally eats hamburgers across the street from his movie’s premieres.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6KcXZyysL7GnmSlrZOWwG6%2BxJqjpbFdna63sYynpmahlJqubsDHmqtmq6SWv27DwKuqZq%2BRqHqxvsSmoJ6qmaO0brXNZquhnZGpsrO%2FjK6lraGcYrWmedaepa1ln6rBbsDOZp6erF2WeqmtzJusq5%2BVp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
