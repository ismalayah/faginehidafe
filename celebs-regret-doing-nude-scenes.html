As fans of the film franchise noted, those shirtless scenes became fewer and further between as the series progressed — something that Lautner himself is proud to have made happen. By the fourth film,&nbsp;"Breaking Dawn Part 1,"&nbsp;Lautner's chiseled abs —&nbsp;which had enjoyed ample screen time in the previous film —&nbsp;were limited to brief cameos.</p><p>"There was some negotiating for sure, oh yeah. There were more [shirtless scenes] when I read the original script, trust me," Lautner told <a href=#>MTV News</a>, explaining that he'd reduced the amount of time he'd have to be shirtless in the film. "Everybody on set, the crew, the cast are wearing clothes; bundles of clothes. And I'm just chillin' there naked,"&nbsp;he explained.</p><p>Years later, he came to realize that being forced to display his buff bod in all those "Twilight"&nbsp;flicks had left him with a certain degree of body dysmorphia. "When I was in it, when I was 16 through 20 years old, starring in this franchise where my character is known for taking his shirt off every other second, no, I did not know that it was affecting me or going to affect me in the future with body image," Lautner told <a href=#>People</a> in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhbIB1hI6cnKWdkqh6s7HGq5ytZZSktq%2BzjKesnZ1dqLCmusSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
