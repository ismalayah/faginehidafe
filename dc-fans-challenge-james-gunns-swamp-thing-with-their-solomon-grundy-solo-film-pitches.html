The DC gaffer’s take on Superman himself should leave plenty of folks watering at the mouth, the oddball opener of Creature Commandos will surely be one to watch as an animated appetizer for what’s to come, and frankly, we could spend hours at a time discussing the possibilities and implications for such projects as The Authority, Booster Gold, Paradise Lost, and The Brave and the Bold.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>But it’s the Swamp Thing film that makes for the most uniquely delectable wildcard, as it’s no secret that it will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dive heavily</a> into the horror genre. An endeavor that Marvel, for instance, has only flirted with in projects such as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Swamp Thing.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Indeed, the fearlessness with which Gunn seems to be exploring the possibilities of these characters is nothing but a good omen, but as far as comic book horror films go, the folks over at r/DC_Cinematic have some ideas of their own.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Challenge: How would you make a Solomon Grundy solo movie? What would your pitch be?</a> from <a href=#>DC_Cinematic</a></figure><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>Those ideas involve none other than Cyrus Gold, aka <strong>Solomon Grundy</strong>, the hulking zombie supervillain and long-time enemy of the Green Lantern and the Justice League as a whole. An immortal baddie is scary enough, but considering that just about every depiction of the character looks like it was ripped from a straight horror flick, this is one character that Gunn won’t want to sleep on in that department. Fans certainly haven’t.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>One user pitched a subversion of the classic Frankenstein story, which would certainly make for a deviant departure from the comic book film formula.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>soniclore’s comment from discussion "Challenge: How would you make a Solomon Grundy solo movie?
