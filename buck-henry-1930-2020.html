His mother Ruth Taylor was a silent film star who appeared in the original version of “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” in 1928, and one wonders if Henry didn't inherit a gift for making an impact as a deadpan actor&nbsp;without dialogue from his mom. Like a lot of writers of his generation, he worked on college humor magazines before graduating from Dartmouth and getting his start in television. He was an actor first on shows like “The New <a href=#>Steve Allen</a> Show,” but it was when he created “Get Smart” with <a href=#>Mel Brooks</a> that everything really changed. People often presume that spoofs of genre shows are easy because the worst ones just exaggerate clichés and already-existing concepts but “Get Smart” was blindingly smart, proving that great parody needs to be not just broader, it needs to be wittier than what it’s parodying to work.</p><p>While “Get Smart” was on the air, Buck Henry wrote the screenplay that would change his life and become a touchstone for a generation, “The Graduate.” The massive hit earned Henry his first and only Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay, and give him the creative freedom to make his own choices for the rest of his career. Buck Henry clearly worked only on projects that interested him, not just to keep working. For example, he would host “Saturday Night Live” ten times in the early years, knowing that his deadpan style was a perfect foil for the broad humor of someone like <a href=#>John Belushi</a>, who worked with Henry regularly in the “samurai” sketches. Years later, he would be perfectly cast in a show inspired by “SNL” when he played Liz Lemon’s father on “30 Rock.”</p><p>In the ‘70s, Buck Henry wrote for <a href=#>Peter Bogdanovich</a>&nbsp;(“What’s Up, Doc?”), adapted <a href=#>Joseph Heller</a>&nbsp;(“<a href=#>Catch-22</a>”), reunited with <a href=#>Mike Nichols</a> again (“<a href=#>The Day of the Dolphin</a>”), gave <a href=#>Barbra Streisand</a> a hit role (“The Owl and the Pussycat”), and directed <a href=#>Warren Beatty</a> in the wonderful “<a href=#>Heaven Can Wait</a>,” which landed Henry his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Director. He often appeared in his works, memorably in “The Graduate,” “Catch-22,” and “Heaven Can Wait,” popping up just long enough to remind you who wrote the movie and that he could work on either side of the camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52RqcKzsdJoma6bm2K1prrRsmRqcWNlenN8kWk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
