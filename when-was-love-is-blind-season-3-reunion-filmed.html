During this time contestants can talk to each other, but not see each other, meaning they must find love by personality alone. Once everyone has made a marriage proposal, the couples get to see each other in person and spend several weeks together, all while planning their upcoming wedding. At the altar each pair must make the ultimate choice: will they go through with the wedding; or will they call it off at the last moment?&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>Love Is Blind proved popular, and thus it got renewed for second and third seasons, the last part of which landed on Netflix on November 9th, 2022.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-when-was-love-is-blind-season-3-s-reunion-special-filmed data-injectable=false>When was ‘Love Is Blind’ season 3’s reunion special filmed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>According <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to TV Guide</a>, the&nbsp;Love Is Blind&nbsp;season three reunion special was filmed around two weeks ago, at the end of October. This means that the contestants will have seen the release of episodes one to seven. They will have also seen social media’s first impressions of them, which likely affected how they acted during the reunion special.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>It should also be noted that there is some debate surrounding this. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify argues</a> that the reunion special was filmed in March, 2022.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Part of the reason for this debate is that the filming schedule for the seasons has shifted over time. While season one was filmed in 2018 and aired in 2020, season two was filmed in the summer of 2021 and aired in early 2022. Once filming for season two wrapped up, season three <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">began shooting immediately</a>, meaning that those contestants never got to watch season two.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>According to co-host Vanessa Lachey, this was due to COVID-19. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Bustle</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>We wanted to make sure that everyone was safe and that everyone was tested appropriately and that we took all the appropriate measures. Because of the restrictions of COVID, I’m actually really impressed that we were able to get such an amazing season off. They had created this really safe bubble for all of us to be comfortable in and for the cast to be comfortable in.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=false>So that is the reason for the confusion and debate. Due to the show’s young age and the effects of COVID-19, the show doesn’t have a predictable shooting pattern at the current time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSnZLCZo2K5sMLEZqCsZZKhtq%2BwjKycmqufo3p0edGerKehn6N6p7XLppydZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
