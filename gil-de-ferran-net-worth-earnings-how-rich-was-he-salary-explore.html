The former Indianapolis 500 champion rose to prominence as a driver and team owner. The world of motor racing has been rocked by the death of one of its biggest figures, Gil De Ferran. As a result, Gil’s personal information, such as his income and net worth, piques the interest of fans. Gil De Ferran was born in Paris, France, on November 11, 1967. However, since he was born in Brazil to Brazilian parents, he participated under their flag. Gil began kart racing at the age of 13 after being inspired by his idol, Emerson Fittipaldi. He subsequently moved to Formula Ford in 1987 and, by 1991, had advanced to Formula Three with Edenbridge Racing.</p><p>De Ferran won the title in 1992 after joining Paul Stewart Racing. This was the start of his remarkable career, which included victories in IndyCar racing, such as winning the Indianapolis 500 in 2003.&nbsp;Gil had three distinct periods as a Formula One manager, all with differing degrees of success, with BAR-Honda and McLaren. He has dabbled with team ownership with De Ferran Motorsports, which competes in the Le Mans Series.&nbsp;Gil was adored and revered across the racing industry for his bold approach on the race and his outgoing nature off the track.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gil-de-ferrans-salary-and-earnings></span>Gil De Ferran’s Salary and Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to most estimations, <strong>Gil De Ferran’s net worth</strong> is between $800,000 and $1.5 million.
